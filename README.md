Projects
Implement a menu that is responsive like one of our company websites:

- https://www.1800contacts.com
- https://helloeyes.ca  
- https://luna.io 

Using the same breakpoints, make sure the rest of your website is also responsive. 

- Use Javascript to validate form. Add in helpful error messaging to determine what is wrong. 

- Use Javascript to display the data from your contact form on your thank you page. 

- Use Javascript on your Projects page to only show projects with a specific type. Use a JSON object to populate all the content on the page.

If these were my project filters: All, Websites, Mobile, Other. Then I would have 4 buttons on this page that would show only projects of the selected type. Feel free to create your own categories, and make sure there are at least 3 “projects” that match. Feel free to use things like lorem ipsum for your filler content, or create your own!

https://picsum.photos/ - for generating random photos with specific sizes.
